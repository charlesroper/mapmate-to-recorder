h2. Mapmate to Recorder

This is a suite of SQL queries, tools and techniques for tranferring data from Mapmate to Recorder 6, both of which are biological recording databases.

The SQL queries are (usually) generated in Access and are virtually unreadable in their raw, unformatted state; therefore, they have been formatted using "SQLinForm":http://www.sqlinform.com/, the online SQL formatting tool, in order to make them more readable to the human eye.
